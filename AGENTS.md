# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked as local Markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Triage uses the five canonical label strings without overrides. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Domain documentation uses a multi-context layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## General

1. Never execute git add or git commit unless explicitly requested.
2. Never delete comments without confirmation.
3. If infeasible, stop and confirm with me before proceeding.
4. Prefer || over ?? for defaults, unless falsy values (e.g., 0, "", false) are valid data.
5. SILENT REFACTOR PASS: Inline single-use helpers, purge pass-through wrappers, reserve encapsulation for multi-use logic. Output final high-cohesion code only.
